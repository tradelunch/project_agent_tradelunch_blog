# Getting Started with Python for Data Science

![Python Data Science](./python-ds.png)

Python is the most popular programming language for data science. This guide will help you get started with the essential libraries and tools.

## Why Python for Data Science?

1. **Rich Ecosystem** - NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
2. **Easy to Learn** - Clean syntax and readable code
3. **Community Support** - Massive community and resources

## Essential Libraries

### NumPy
NumPy provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(arr.mean())  # 3.0
```

### Pandas
Pandas is perfect for data manipulation and analysis.

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
    'age': [25, 30, 35]
})
print(df)
```

## Next Steps

1. Install Python and Jupyter
2. Learn basic NumPy and Pandas
3. Start with simple datasets
4. Build your first data analysis project

Happy learning!
