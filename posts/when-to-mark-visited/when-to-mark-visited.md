title: "When to Mark Visited"
tags: [algorithms, graph, bfs, dfs, dijkstra, visited, queue, stack]
desc: The meaning of visited depends on the algorithm's correctness guarantee. In BFS and DFS, visited means the node is discovered or entered, so it must be marked immediately to prevent duplicate work and cycles. In Dijkstra, visited means the node's shortest distance is finalized, which only becomes true when the node is extracted as the minimum from the priority queue. The difference comes from edge weights and optimality requirements, not traversal style.

# When to Mark `visited`: BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra Explained Precisely

![when-to-mark-visited thumbnail](./when-to-mark-visited.png)

## Abstract

One of the most common sources of bugs in graph algorithms is marking a node as `visited` at the wrong time. This article explains _exactly_ when and why nodes must be marked visited in **BFS**, **DFS**, and **Dijkstra**, based on their formal correctness invariants—not intuition or convention.

---

## The Core Idea

The timing of `visited` is not an implementation detail. It encodes **what property of the node has become irreversible**.

> A node must be marked `visited` **at the moment the algorithm’s guarantee becomes final**.

Each algorithm has a different guarantee. Therefore, each marks `visited` at a different time.

---

## BFS (Breadth-First Search)

### What `visited` Means

**Visited = discovered**

Once a node is discovered in BFS, the shortest path (in number of edges) to that node is already known.

### Why This Works

- All edges have equal weight
- BFS explores level by level
- The first time a node is reached is optimal

### Correct Invariant

> A node must enter the queue at most once.

### Correct Timing

Mark `visited` **when enqueuing**, not when dequeuing.

### Correct Pattern

```python
if neighbor not in visited:
    visited.add(neighbor)
    queue.append(neighbor)
```

### What Breaks if You Mark Late

- Duplicate enqueues
- Redundant processing
- Potential exponential blowup in dense graphs

---

## DFS (Depth-First Search)

### What `visited` Means

**Visited = entered**

Once DFS enters a node, re-entering it provides no new information and creates cycles.

### Why This Works

- DFS is about coverage, not optimality
- Cycles must be prevented immediately

### Correct Invariant

> A node must never be entered more than once along the active call stack.

### Correct Timing

Mark `visited` **when entering the node** (before recursion).

### Correct Recursive Pattern

```python
def dfs(node):
    visited.add(node)
    for n in node.neighbors:
        if n not in visited:
            dfs(n)
```

### What Breaks if You Mark Late

- Infinite recursion in cyclic graphs
- Exponential revisits in DAGs

---

## Dijkstra’s Algorithm

### What `visited` Means

**Visited = distance finalized**

A node may be discovered multiple times with improving distances. `visited` means no further improvement is possible.

### Why Early Marking Is Wrong

- Edge weights vary
- First discovery is not necessarily optimal
- A later path may be cheaper

### Correct Invariant

> When a node is extracted as the global minimum from the priority queue, its shortest distance is final.

### Correct Timing

Mark `visited` **when the node is popped from the priority queue**.

### Correct Pattern

```python
while pq:
    dist, u = heappop(pq)
    if u in visited:
        continue
    visited.add(u)
    for v, w in graph[u]:
        relax(u, v, w)
```

### What Breaks if You Mark Early

Incorrect shortest paths.

Example:

```
A --10--> B
A --1--> C --1--> B
```

Early marking fixes B at distance 10 and blocks the optimal path of 2.

## Comparison Table

| Algorithm | Edge Weights | Meaning of `visited` | When to Mark |
| --------- | ------------ | -------------------- | ------------ |
| BFS       | Equal        | Discovered           | Enqueue      |
| DFS       | Irrelevant   | Entered              | Entry / Push |
| Dijkstra  | Non-negative | Distance finalized   | Min-pop      |

---

## Unifying Rule

All three algorithms follow the same principle:

> **Mark a node visited when the algorithm’s correctness guarantee becomes irreversible.**

- BFS: irreversible at discovery
- DFS: irreversible at entry
- Dijkstra: irreversible at minimum extraction

---

## Final Insight

If you cannot clearly state _what property becomes final when you mark `visited`_, the implementation is likely incorrect.

This is not a stylistic choice.
It is a correctness condition.
